«WebArtGallery» is about making a fictive but functional webpage for a fictive webgallery/web-based art dealer, showing various paintings and art prints for sale. There is buttons for filtering to easier find your favorite painting/ print, plus your preferred prize level. When you click in on the various images, you will get options for trying out different wall colors, and different framing. The front page also have a header in black at the top, and a button for information about the fictive company behind the page, their contact information and so on.

To make this page I ve used HTML, CSS, JavaScript. HTML mainly for the structure, CSS for the overall styling and JavaScript for making the page dynamic and functional,        

Status: Under development but stable and working. The filtering buttons are functional and working, the system is by now build for showing one category at the time, while the ideal and planned version will have possibility for combining different option buttons. There will also be more options for styling when you click in on an image. There is also plans for a system for costumer transactions, shopping cart and payment system/link for PayPal.

Browser support: No known browser issues.

The webpage has responsive design suited for all formats, but is made for and works the best on bigger screens.

 Referances: The resources is mainly used due to work with JavaScript. Mostly things we learned in-and from the documentation of- lectures at school. I have also used resources from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ . To the color option in the styling alternatives I used resources from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-background-color-changer-using-html-css-and-javascript/ . I have done adjustments and modifications to help fit the resources into my project when needed, and/or used resources as inspiration for solutions and angles.
